# CS170-Project1
An implementation of an 8-puzzle solver using Uniform Cost Search and A* search with Misplaced Tile and Manhattan Distance heuristics. This project explores how different heuristics impact search efficiency by comparing solution depth, nodes expanded, and queue size across puzzles of varying difficulty.
